# UWPHomeDiagnosticClient

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the UWPHomeDiagnosticClient, which is a diagnostic client program developed as part of a university assignment. The client program provides a graphical user interface to control a simulated room with multiple sensors and displays their data in a clear and debuggable way.

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to create a diagnostic client program for a simulated room with multiple sensors. The client program allows users to interact with the room and its sensors through a graphical user interface and provides visualizations of the sensor data for debugging and analysis purposes. The project also includes the development or acquisition of a simulator to simulate the room and sensor behavior.
