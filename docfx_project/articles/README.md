# Homework

The homework is to create a diagnostic client program for a simulated or real robot or other embedded system. The client program will provide a graphical user interface to control the robot and to display the data from the robot in a clear and debuggable way. In the case of a simulated robot, the provision (writing, purchasing) of a simulator is also part of the task for the sake of demonstrability, and will be exemplified in the lecture.
